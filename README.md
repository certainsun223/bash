# Bash Scripting Tasks

This repository contains scripts for learning and practicing Bash scripting.  

## Completed Tasks

1. **Basic Arithmetic**  
   - `arithmetic.sh`: Takes two numbers from the user and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. **File Operations**  
   - `file_operations.sh`: Creates a directory, navigates into it, creates a file, writes text to it, and displays its content.

3. **Conditional Statements**  
   - `check_file.sh`: Checks if a file exists and reports its read/write/execute permissions.

4. **Backup Script**  
   - `backup_txt.sh`: Copies all `.txt` files from a source directory to a backup directory, creating the backup directory if it doesn’t exist.
